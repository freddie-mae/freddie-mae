- 👋 Hi, I’m Mae (Freddie is my nickname - only if we get on!!), a self-taught front end dev based in London UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in front end using Vue.js, React and UX/UI Design, FinTech and Ecommerce. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java (and forever learning JavaScript!!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects to add to my portfolio, and collab with back-end devs to create something we can both benefit from.
- 📫 How to reach me - follow my journey and thought on swicthing careers on twitter @freddiem_codes
